I've taught this class for a number of years now and it has always been one of my favourites. It was usurped for a time by "Implementing and Auditing the CIS 20 Critical Controls" (SEC566) as 512 became a bit dated and I found 566 to be a bit more relevant. However, that all changed this year when a significant re-write was completed and the new version of the course went live. Frank Kim and other contributors have done a great job of bringing this back to be a true essentials course.

I've taught a couple of classes already and have a bunch more lined up this year so I thought I'd take some time to give a run-down of the new material and let you know what to expect. This class has quickly risen in the popularity ranks once again and it's a great opportunity for people in a variety of roles to get a thorough introduction to security and management principles. Stay tuned for the next 5 posts to learn more about this great class.
