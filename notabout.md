Hi, I'm Kenton Smith and I'm an IT Security professional living and working in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  

This blog is just a sport for me to post things that I want to promote (like the teaching I'm doing for SANS) and ideas and thoughts related to IT, technology, and security.  

I'm a consultnat in Calgary and I specialize in helping companies to build and manage their cybersecurity program.  

If you're interested in hiring me, see my [company website](http://kgssec.com) or fill out the contact form [here](mailto:info@kgssec.com)
